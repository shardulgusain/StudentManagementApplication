## Lessons Learned

The main thing I learned while building this Student CRUD CLI based application is how JAVA connects to MySQL database using JDBC api. 
A SQL statement is precompiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object. This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple times.

Basically we are not required to write cumbersome  SQL queries in our java application thanks to JDBC api .JDBC makes it possible to do the following things within a Java application:

*Establish a connection with a data source.

*Send queries and update statements to the data source.

*Process the results.

The JDBC API is implemented through the JDBC driver. The JDBC Driver which id nothing but a set of classes that implement the JDBC interfaces to process JDBC calls and return result sets to a Java application. The database stores the data retrieved by the application using the JDBC Driver.
